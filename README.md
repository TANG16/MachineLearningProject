Discriminative vs Generative learning
======================
Instructor: Andrea Passerini

Evaluate two simple learning algorithms, one generative and one discriminative, on a binary classification task.

Linear classifiers:
- Naive Bayes
- Perceptron

The “UCI Machine Learning Repository” is a collection of datasets commonly used to evaluate learning algorithms:

Choose two datasets with Categorical attributes and Binary classification task.

Chosen Datasets
- KRKPA7 [king rook vs king pawn (chess)]
- voting records (congress)

Task
- Implement Naive Bayes and Perceptron
- Run 10-fold cross validation on the two datasets
- Report cross validated accuracies of the two classifiers for each dataset
